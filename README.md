# **📝 Free Scribe**  

## **🚀 Overview**  
Free Scribe is a voice-to-text transcription and translation tool built using React. This project allows users to **record their voice**, **convert speech into text**, and **translate the transcribed text into multiple languages** using machine learning models. It serves as a great introduction to integrating **speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and translation APIs** into a React application.

## **📌 Features**  
✅ **Real-time Speech-to-Text** – Convert spoken words into text using voice input.  
✅ **Multi-Language Translation** – Translate the transcribed text into multiple languages.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive UI for seamless usage.  
✅ **Copy & Share Functionality** – Copy transcriptions and share them easily.  
✅ **Lightweight & Fast** – Optimized for speed and efficiency.

## **📌 Future Improvements**  
🔹 Add support for **offline transcription**.  
🔹 Enhance **speech accuracy** using custom ML models.  
🔹 Implement **a dark mode** for better UI experience.  
🔹 Save and manage past transcriptions.  
🔹 Add a **mobile-friendly PWA version**.  

This project was an exciting way to explore **React, speech recognition, and translation APIs**, and I’m looking forward to expanding its capabilities! 🚀🎙️
